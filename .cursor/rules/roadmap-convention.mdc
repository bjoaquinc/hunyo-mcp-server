# Always check tests FIRST to understand expected format
hatch run test test/test_roadmap_validation.py -v

# Required formats (tests are source of truth):
✅ **IMPLEMENTED** `server.py` (94 lines)  # NOT "✅ IMPLEMENTED - server.py"
✅ **Create `pyproject.toml`**              # NOT "✅ COMPLETE - Create..."  
✅ **172/174 tests passing** (99% success rate, 2 skipped)  # Exact text expected

# Process: test → read current → update → test again
