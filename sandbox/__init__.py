Interactive Development Sandbox

This directory serves as an interactive development playground for marimo-based development and testing.

PURPOSE: Interactive marimo development, experimentation, and real-time verification of hunyo-capture functionality

CONTENTS:
- test_notebook.py: Full-featured marimo app for interactive development and testing
- __marimo__/: Auto-generated marimo cache/state directory

USAGE: Run `marimo edit test_notebook.py` to launch an interactive browser-based development environment.
The notebook automatically initializes unified tracking and provides real-time feedback on capture functionality.

AUDIENCE: Developers working on hunyo-capture integration and debugging

BENEFITS:
- Real-time testing of DataFrame operations and lineage capture
- Interactive experimentation with different data transformations
- Immediate feedback on hook installation and event generation
- Browser-based development environment with live updates

NOTE: This is NOT test data - it's a development workspace. For automated test fixtures,
see tests/fixtures/ instead.
