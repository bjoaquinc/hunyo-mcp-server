# Capture Layer Validation Report

## Testing Results Summary

### ✅ Core Utilities Working
- **File naming utilities**: Hash generation, name extraction, file path creation all working correctly
- **Platform-specific data directories**: Using correct macOS path (`~/Library/Application Support/marimo-lineage-mcp`)
- **Directory structure**: Runtime, lineage, and database directories created properly

### ✅ Runtime Tracker Working
- **Initialization**: Correctly creates unique filenames using notebook path hash
- **Event logging**: Successfully writes JSON events to runtime files
- **Cell execution tracking**: Context manager and execution ID system working
- **Result capture**: Smart handling of different result types (DataFrames, arrays, large objects)
- **Session management**: Session summaries and statistics working

### ✅ Lineage Interceptor Working  
- **Initialization**: Properly integrates with runtime tracker
- **Hook installation**: Successfully installs live tracking hooks for pandas/numpy
- **Event capture**: Creates lineage event files (though fewer events in simple tests)
- **Integration**: Runtime debugging and session management working

### ✅ Marimo Integration Working
- **Test file execution**: `test_capture_integration.py` runs without errors
- **File creation**: Event files created with correct unique naming
- **Path resolution**: Correctly handles notebook path detection and hash generation
- **Component integration**: Both runtime and lineage trackers work together

## File Structure Validation

```
/Users/fatimaarkin/Library/Application Support/marimo-lineage-mcp/
├── events/
│   ├── runtime/
│   │   └── {hash}_{name}_runtime_events.jsonl
│   └── lineage/
│       └── {hash}_{name}_lineage_events.jsonl
└── database/
    └── lineage.duckdb (will be created by ingestion layer)
```

## Key Features Confirmed

1. **Unique File Naming**: Each notebook gets unique event files based on filepath hash
2. **Platform-Specific Storage**: Events stored in appropriate OS-specific directories
3. **Runtime Event Logging**: Cell executions tracked with timing, memory, and results
4. **Lineage Event Capture**: Data operations intercepted and logged
5. **Session Management**: Both trackers maintain session state and summaries
6. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Next Steps

1. **Install DuckDB**: Required for ingestion layer (`pip install duckdb`)
2. **Implement Ingestion Layer**: File watching and database ingestion
3. **Create MCP Server**: Expose SQL tables via MCP tools
4. **End-to-End Testing**: Full pipeline from capture to query

## Issues Identified

1. **Lineage path detection**: Still uses old path detection logic (minor issue)
2. **Verbose logging**: Lineage interceptor produces very verbose debug output
3. **Missing dependencies**: DuckDB not installed yet (expected)

## Overall Status: ✅ WORKING

The capture layer is functioning correctly and ready for the next phase of development. All core components are operational and producing the expected event files in the correct locations.
