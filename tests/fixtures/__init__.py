"""
Test Fixtures for Automated Testing

This directory contains standardized test data and fixtures used by automated test suites.

PURPOSE: Provides minimal, predictable test notebooks for CI/CD and integration testing

CONTENTS:
- test_notebook.py: Simple marimo notebook for basic integration tests
- real_marimo_cell_execution_notebook.py: More complex but controlled test scenario

USAGE: These files are imported by pytest test cases and should remain stable and predictable.
They are designed for automated consumption, not interactive development.

AUDIENCE: Test runners, CI/CD systems, automated test suites
